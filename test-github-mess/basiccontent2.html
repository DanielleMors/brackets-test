                </h4>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was to make a 1 minute short movie about anything we wanted. In this assignment I learned about the basic recording and edit techniques. This was my first introduction to Premiere Pro. Which was easy to understand because I have worked with imovie a lot and I felt like it was similar but there are way more options in Premiere Pro, which was really nice to use. I gained knowledge about all different shots. For my video I used a close up and a medium shot and only used jump cuts throughout the movie.

                <h4>05.02.01 WEBSITE WITH VIDEO </h4>
                <p>For this assignment we had to make a 3 minute video for the client Tjubang Sko. The focus for the video was, is to create a feeling for the customer while they're on their website and facebook.Before all that we had to brainstorm about the logo, color scheme, typography and so on. For the logo we all drew a couple of sketches and then we picked the one we liked best. Same goes for the website layout and design and basically for all other design choices we did. We pretty much did it like we did with the design sprint, but with less steps. </p>


                <p>My part in this project was the video. I filmed almost everything and I also edited the movie on my own. One of my other classmates focused on coding the website and my other classmate focused on taking and editing the pictures for our project. I learned a lot about editing by using Premier Pro. In our video I had to do a lot of color editing, which was a lot of work but in the end it looked so much better.

                </h4>
                <p>In this assignment we were introduced to writing a treatment for the movie. Our movie had a double story line about a mother making certain choices in her life. Because we wanted a split video we first wrote all the different choices the mother is going to make and from there we wrote the treatment. This was a group assignment so we all wrote this together.

                <p>
                    For this assignment we had to make the storyboard for our whole movie. We made the storyboard in this way so that if someone without any knowledge about the story can easily shoot this whole movie. </p>


                <p>Julia drew the story board while me and the others were deciding on what location to use, what the angle was going to be, if there were any camera movements, transitions or important sounds, a short description what was happening in that shot and the props that were needed for each shot. For our story board we used a lot of medium shots and close ups. For a couple of shots we wanted to use panning, but our camera somehow couldnâ€™t connect to the stabilizer we rented from school. So we tried to do everything with the tripod, which turned out alright. </p>

                    05.02.05 PITCH FOR CUSTOMER</h4>

                <p>The goal for our pitch was to convince the client of our video and their new website and logo design. We did this with a nice presented powerpoint with our solution, visual identity, shoe size guide, mobile experience, social media and our product, which was our website and video. For the pitch I made the powerpoint together with another classmate. And together we worked on the pich so that one of us could present this to the client.  </p>
