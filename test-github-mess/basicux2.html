                <h4>03.01.01 DATA COLLECTION
                </h4>
                <p>For desk research I researched how the use of social media and teenagers are connected to bullying. This really interested me since I did research about social media in the upbringing writing my thesis with my previous bachelor studies. It was easy gathering information about this subject on the internet, since social media is so big among teenagers. </p>

                <p>An observation research is a way of collecting information just by observing someone or a situation and just writing down the facts. I did my research on one of my classmates while we were working together. It was interesting to see how my expectations were so different than the outcome of my observation. </p>

                <p>The interview research is a method where you ask prepared questions to a person about a subject, opinion etcetera. It is important not to ask closed questions where they can only answer yes or no. In depth questions will get you more information. My interview was semi-structured since I had prepared questions, but also when I felt like I wanted to go in on what she was telling I did ask different questions then I prepared beforehand. </p>


                <p>A survey is a way of getting information and an overview about a specific group of people their opinion or situation. For our survey we used google forms and me and my classmate were investigating how the housing situation of the students of KEA is. All this in relation to how long they’ve been here and we also looked at the job situation. </p>

                <h4>03.02.01 CONTENT PRODUCTION</h4>
                <p>
                    For this assignment I had to produce written content for a mobile website that matches the needs of a specific target person, which were my fellow students, but also a specific sender which in my case was a creative instagrammer.</p>

                <p>
                    I had to find a recipe from my home country and around that build the content for the specific target person. I had a small interview with one of my classmates so my target person was clear. For the tone of voice I chose to be serious but funny. The content was pretty casual but it was still written in a respectful way since the sender also want her receivers to make that recipe. I used a wireflow to draw and explain how my mobile page should look in the end. The microcopy on this page is to make the user feel more invited to the page and eventually make the recipe. I did this by adding simple stuff like that they can also add meat in their recipe since it is originally a vegetarian recipe. Also by adding casual questions like: do you want to sign up? Or Thanks for sharing, I hope you enjoyed it, make the whole tone of voice casual as well. For more explanation: see PDF.

                <h4>03.03.01 PROTOTYPE</h4>
                <p>For this assignment I had to produce a clickable prototype for a small web shop with a maximum of 10 products. My prototype was made for parents who want to buy fruit for their children. The focus of this assignment was on UI and UX conventions, design patterns and UI kits.</p>

                <p>I wanted the website to look welcoming and easy to navigate, since parents are busy in
                    general, they don’t want to waste much time. They can click on different fruits and see what
                    the nutrition value is and where they can use it for (recipes etc.). To order they don’t have to have
                    an account, but the option is there.</p>

                <p>During this assignment I learned how important it is to make a sitemap so you can get an overview and a clear picture of how your website is going to navigate and work. Same goes for making a wireframe. I’ve made a wireframe in previous assignments but with this assignment is was super helpful since this website excisted out of a lot of pages and it was easy to forget stuff if you didn’t make it. I also learned about which global elements should recur on all pages and which local elements just occur once. Like a picture of fruit that I sell on my website.</p>

                <p>I used the 5 second test to study my page. I also did this test with my roommates. I asked them a couple of questions afterwards about my shopping page and found out they couldn’t see prices for the items. And that there wasn’t a shopping basket on the page either.</p>

                <h4>03.04.01 DESIGN SPRINT</h4>
                <p>
                    This assignment was a group project where we had to use a design sprint method to create a native app concept improving student life and studying for KEA students. We had all the freedom to create this native app which was pretty fun.</p>

                <p>In this project I was the decider so whenever we had to make a decision and we couldn’t decide on something, I would be the one that said ok we’re going to do it like this. We used team canvas to brainstorm on ideas an goals and also to come up with the roles in our team. This worked really well in our team. The goal we came up with for our native app was: to solve all kinds of problems students might have through other students. We found that it can be hard sometimes to ask for help with a specific task or question, especially in the beginning of the semester. And our long term goal would to expand the app to other universities and teachers. For our sprint questions we asked ourselves how we could fail? We came up with the next problems:
                    - not enough students sign up
                    - More help needed than offered
                    - Students might expect money for the help they offer (like tutoring)
                    After that we drew a map how we want our users to interact with our native app.</p>

                <p> The next day we had a rough idea of what we wanted, we all drew a couple of sketches in 10 minutes and after that we all showed our sketches to each other and voted which of the sketches we liked best. For the next step we divided a piece of paper (in our case on the computer) in 8 pieces and then we used our favourite sketches to make a variation of our best ideas in all of the frames. After that we all drew a story board with our favourite ideas to eventually come up with a solution. The next day we had to decide which solution sketch we wanted to use. So we used a couple of ways to vote for it. The heat map showed us best which idea we liked most, since 3 out of 4 people drew a dot on that solution. After all the test we had the best solution for our native app. In the end I had to decide which sketch we wanted to make a prototype of. Which was pretty weird for me, but it worked out well and everyone had the same thought which was good.</p>

                <p> On the 3rd day we had to make the actual prototype. We already drew or wireframes the day before since we were faster than we thought. To keep track of our project we used trello to see what needed to be done, what was done and what we were working on. We pretty much did everything together and that worked out really well. For the interview we asked two roommates of one of our group member. While she did the interview we all took notes. We got a couple of insights after the interviews:
                    - We added a home button in the burger menu
                    - Changed the burger menu button into a back button on a couple of screens.
                    - We changed some elements like fonts on the homepage
                    - We made our logo bigger and more obvious
                    - Some of our buttons were misplaced

                <h4>03.04.02 PITCH DECK</h4>
                <p>For the pitch we had to come up with a clear and and of course a convincing solution for our native app we created. In the pitch we described our first problem, our solution, our target users our goal and long term goal and the app’s value and key players. Our tasks were pretty simple for the pitch, we all wrote the pitch together and we also made our slides together. For us this worked out really well.</p>
