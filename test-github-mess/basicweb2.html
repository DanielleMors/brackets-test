                <h4>02.01.01 RUSSIAN CONSTRUCTIVISM</h4>
                <p>The focus of this assignment was to build a mobile-size page and getting to know the basics of html and css. The websites content contained information about Russian constructivism. I felt it was important, to also get that feeling of that period of time, that’s why I used the red and black colors and used a kind of typography that fits that feeling too.</p>

                <p> During this theme I learned how a html structure looks like. I learned about different kinds of sementic markups to give my page a good structure. To make our page look nice, we of course had to use images. That’s how I learned how to crop them and also how to export them in the right way and format. I learned that is important to keep all your files in the root folder and how to organise it consistently.</p>

                <p>To keep track of my learning process and problems that occurred, I kept a log during this entire theme. One of the problems I faced was that I had a hard time cutting the images in photoshop. I couldn’t figure out how to get a circled shape image as a png. So I watched this tutorial and it was really simple, I just had shape a circle with the elliptical tool, inverse it and then delete the other part and then simply deselect it again. This helped me a lot throughout the rest of the semester with all kinds of images.

                <h4>02.02.01 THE HISTORY OF THE MICRO COMPUTER</h4>
                <p>In this assignment the focus was on building a responsive website with a grid based layout with multiple pages. A couple new elements were introduced, such as: internal linking, the navigation, an ordered list and an unordered list. All the elements from the last project were used as well and it was easy to add those new elements into my new website about computers.</p>

                <p>This was the first time I was introduced to a grid layout. In the beginning it was quite confusing, but with the grid layout view in adobe XD it made it so much easier to understand. Later when I had to add all the media query’s it was quite difficult to adjust my grid layout in those media’s. Also because I never made a prototype for my mobile and tablet view, which would have been so much easier if I made those beforehand so I knew how I wanted it to look. So that is one important thing I learned during this project, how important it is to have a prototype for all sizes.

                <h4>02.03.01 PHOTOGRAPHY TUTORIAL
                </h4>
                <p>The focus of this assignment was a lot on the design part of the website. Everyone was given an art style. My art style was street art, so the first thing I did was researching about street art and with the images and information I found I created my moodboard to create a general feeling for my website. Based on my moodboard I created a styletile where I chose the right typography and colors. I like a simple look so this was kind of hard with the art style street art. But I managed to use a font that give that right feeling and also use this grafitti image for my header but I chose to cut out the letters which made it more clean and still street art. </p>


                <p>During this theme I also learned a lot about the different gestalt laws. For example I wanted to have a simple looking page, that’s why I made it symmetrical, which also for me made it more understandable to put in a grid layout. I already knew how important proximity was, but it made it even more clear when I was putting all my headers and text in my html. Sometimes the header was too far away from the text and closer to another bit of text, which made it look like it belonged to the wrong piece of text. This also comes back to the amount of white space you use in your composition.</p>

                <p>For this website I also had to create a logo relevant to our website. This is how I learned to use the pen tool in Photoshop. I basically followed the letters I wanted with the pen tool and adjusted them with the convert point tool. This was really useful, but sometimes quite difficult to use.
                </p>

                <p>There were a couple of testing methods, but I used the trunk test for my website. Just by asking a couple of people (which were my roommates) 6 simple questions when they’re on my website. After this method I realised they couldn’t see clearly where they were on my page. </p>
