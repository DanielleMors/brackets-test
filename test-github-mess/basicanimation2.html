                <h4>04.01.01 DESCRIPTION OF IDEA
                </h4>
                <p>For this assignment I had to create an idea and sketches for my future game, which is the final assignment. The game has to be a single ‘clicker’ game where you can get points and lose health. There should be two different ending either you’re game (no points, no health or no time left) over or you win the game.</p>

                <p>
                    My game idea comes from the fact I love plants but I always manage to kill them, so I thought it would be a fun idea to make a plant mom game, where you have to keep your plants alive. During this assignment I learned how to make a activity diagram. Making the diagram made it easier to understand how my game would end or how you can win. Which was very useful later on coding the game in javascript.

                <h4>04.01.02 ASSETLIST AND DESIGN</h4>


                <p>We weren’t allowed to use strokes which made it an interesting way to create this. I created a character, a background image, the good and bad elements and the UI-elements. </p>

                <p>This time using illustrator I learned so much better how to use the programme. With a previous project I couldn’t figure out how to get certain shapes. I learned to cut shapes with the pathfinder divide tool which made everything so much easier. Learned a couple of short cuts like cmd { to put stuff to the background or to the foreground. I also learned a little about 3D character design. I felt like my character looked quiet boring as a flat design, so I tried to make it 3D with some tutorials I got send by my teacher. I end up not using them as a 3D version since I felt it didn’t match with the rest of my game. I later on in the game used it for all my buttons. </p>

                <h4>04.05.03 THE FINAL GAME
                </h4>
                <p>In this assignment I had to create an interactive, animated game. It is a single clicker game so when you click you can get points or lose lives. The game only exists out of a single level. </p>

                <p>
                    During this assignment I learned a lot. It was a quite difficult assignment for me with a lot of struggles but in the end I had a working game, which was pretty cool. The most important thing I learned was of course javascript, but also the hardest. The way I learned best was watching all the instruction videos of the coin clicker and the ball game and while watching trying it myself. This was so helpful. So later I could implement what I’ve learned from the coin clicker and ball game in my own game. It made it easier to understand. I learned about sprites and containers and how to animate the sprite in the container. I can still learn a lot about the css positioning and the if, else if and else. I feel like that was difficult for me to do, but I made it work in the end.
